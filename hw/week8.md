### Homework 8 (Part 1 is due Monday, part 2 is due Sunday, October 30, 2016)

This week's homework is to complete your vehicle chassis and do another code tracing exercise.

1. **Assignment:** Complete your vehicle chassis, to be ready for your Arduino and breadboard next week.
   
   Assume a full-size breadboard.
   
   Leave room for a battery pack so that your vehicle can run without being attached to your computer. We will provide either rechargable USB batteries or 9V batteries.
   
   If you don't have a caster it might be sufficient to provide a skid or other device that slides smoothly on the floor.
   

2. **Assignment:** Trace the code in [this pdf](https://github.com/zamfi/cca-programming-electronics-fall-2016-monday/blob/master/hw/tracer.pdf?raw=true) as though you are the computer, like we did in class.
   1. For each new variable, add a new entry to the Computer Memory table.
   2. For every change in a variable's value, update the entry in the table, legibly crossing out the old value, like this update from 3 to 4:

      ![was 3, now 4](img/3-no-4.png)
   3. For every drawing command, draw the result on the canvas. (This exercise is all monochrome.)
   4. Tally (or draw a line or dot) to the left of each line as you evaluate it. (Some lines will be evaluated many times!)
   5. Scan & upload the printed exercise sheet to github (new repository for this assignment) and bring the original with you to class.
