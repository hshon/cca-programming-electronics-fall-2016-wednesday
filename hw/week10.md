### Homework 9 (due Sunday, November 13, 2016)

Homework this week consists of a project proposal with the following additional details. 

Please read carefully and comply with the instructions:

2. Include links to tutorials and any other references you think will be especially helpful in accomplishing your project
3. Place orders for the parts you need. We encourage you to check with us before you buy since our experience might save you from wasting time and money on the wrong parts. 
4. If you plan to use parts from the Hybrid Lab, check them out right away so that they are in your possession.
5. Your proposal is due on Sunday November 13 by 5 PM. **Late proposals will not be accepted!**
