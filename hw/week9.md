### Homework 9 (due Sunday, November 6, 2016)

1. Final Project thoughts.

  - Your final project will take up the bulk of your classwork for the 2nd
half of term. Think about what you'd like to do, and [send
us](mailto:jzamfirescpereira@cca.edu,mshiloh@cca.edu) a 5-10 sentence
description of what you'd like to do by **Sunday night, November 6**. The
sooner you send us your thoughts, the sooner we can provide you with feedback and you can iterate. We'll probably go through a revision or two before you have a final idea to implement.

    Here are some notes:

    - Your project should have a significant programming component and electronic comonent.
    - It should have some kind of input: maybe a sensor or two, a remote control, a touch control, a computer input -- perhaps through P5?
    - It should have some kind of output: motors, LEDs, a P5 sketch on the web, sound, video playback, a graph of data, etc.
    - It should have an artistic component.
    - It could have a mechanical component.

  - Examples of pretty good projects include:
    - Laser Light Dance Floor: a repurposed DDR pad that controls music playback and a laser light show.
    - Lit Planters: a set of 3D-printed plants that respond to people walking around and interacting.
    - Piano player: molded plastic fingers, connected to servo motors with strings, that pull the fingers down to play an electric keyboard. Reads the MIDI format and plays music!
    - SensorBot: a wall-detecting robot that follows the walls in a room, measuring distance and light level as it goes.
    - Wall Drawbot: a wall-mounted pen controlled by an Arduino that can draw an arbitrary drawing, perhaps from an SVG file.

  - Be creative! This is your chance to play with the concepts that excite you the most.

  - **As we mentioned above, we will likely go through a bit of a
back-and-forth to refine your project idea -- the sooner you send it to us the more time you'll have to work on it!**
  
  - In class, you'll start to write a proposal for your final project. If you have questions about a particular component or concept, bring it or bring a prototype.
  
2. Prepare for the in-class quiz on Monday, November 7! As a reminder, here are the rules and expectations for the quiz:

   - Open-notes -- bring whatever notes you wish, including the practice quiz! Printed-out notes are fine.
   - No electronic devices allowed -- no mobile phones, no laptops, no tables, no kindles, no Arduinos -- in short, nothing electronic and nothing that can run code (except your brain!)
