### Homework 7 (due Sunday, October 23, 2016)

This week's homework is to prepare for the upcoming in-class examination. Download, print out, and complete this [practice quiz](practice-quiz.pdf). Instructions:

- The in-class examination will be open-book, open-notes, but closed-computer. (No digital devices will be allowed.) The format will be very similar to this practice quiz.

- To complete the practice quiz, take as long as you need (though be aware that we'll give you 2 hours in class), see what you can do without your computer, and use whatever notes you plan to bring. This is also a good opportunity for you to flesh out your notes if you're missing anything.

- Scan (or photograph with your cell phone) your completed practice quiz and [email it to us](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu,mshiloh@cca.edu) (don't put this in github) by Sunday night, 11:59pm on October 23.

**Also, if you didn't complete last week's homework assignment, do so now!**
